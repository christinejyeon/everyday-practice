# We should partition the data first, I think?
# Total 34 months and compare each month's sales data
# Cluster 34 months in small groups too? Like in terms of seasons?
# Draw a graph first. But how will I draw a graph?
# How about dividing the analysis according to the shop first?
# Since it's a prediction for how many items have been sold, no need to pivot by item I guess?
